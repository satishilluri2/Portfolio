                    <p style="text-align: justify;" id = "para"> The main purpose of this idea is to reduce to the man power on drip irrigation
                    system. The research problem that motivates the project was the heavy work load for
                    the farmers to turn the valves, close the valves, wait until the whole field get wet and
                    then off the motor. As a part of our field visit we visited that village and noticed that,
                    90 percent of people’s main occupation is Cultivation. Most of them use drip systems
                    as the water amount is less in village. The main problem that we have noticed is even
                    in the drip systems however the water gets equally distributed, when there is less of
                    amount of waterflow in some areas the water cannot the distributed equally and also as
                    it takes more time, the farmer has to stay there, it would be very problem for the
                    farmer.This product is developed to reduce to the manpower on drip irrigation system. The
                    research problem that motivates the project was the heavy workload for the farmers
                    to turn the valves, close the valves and wait until the whole field get wet and then
                    switch off the motor. This product helps the farmers to decrease the work load. This
                    idea is all about the mobile application in which the motors and valves can be
                    controlled on the basis of farmer needs.

                        <P style="text-align: justify;">
                        The problem that has emerged in e-commerce shopping is, customers, getting fake products in place of original products. 
                        This will decrease the sales and profit of the particular brand, including companies’ reputation. 
                        To remove or reduce the number of customers getting fake products in e-commerce shopping implemented using QR codes. 
                        Here Blockchain technology comes into the picture, where a QR code is generated using blockchain technology and attached to the product at the manufacturer’s side. 
                        Customers when they received the product can scan the QR code and check the authenticity of the product.
                        </P>
                        <P style="text-align: justify;">
                        we proposed a system using a web application. The web application is given to e-commerce companies as well as manufacturers, 
                        where sellers and e-commerce companies have a connection. This web application is added as functionality between e-commerce companies and the seller side. 
                        Where the product details are entered by the manufacturer using this application and will get a QR code once completed the transaction and the QR code is attached to the product Once the product or item is received by the end-user or customer, 
                        the QR code will be scanned by the end user and the end user will get to know whether the product is genuine or fake.
                        </P>
                        <center><img src="./img/PIC.png"></center>
                        <P style="text-align: justify;">
                        There is no good solution before to differentiate fake products from original products. 
                        Blockchain technology can be helpful to tackle such problems. The project’s main goal is to help people to identify whether the product is an original product or a fake product.
                        We proposed a fake product detection system using blockchain technology for the detection of counterfeit products. The proposed system ensures the detection of fake products in day-to-day life. 
                        Block-Supply chain eliminates the need for a centralized authentication server utilized in most existing supply chains. Instead, it involves the nodes in the supply chain to do the authentication. 
                        Additionally, it can trace- and-track products without a centralized tracking server. Moreover, it detects the three counterfeiting attacks (modification, cloning, and tag reapplication) by involving the supply chain nodes transparently.
