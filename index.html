                        <P style="text-align: justify;">
                        The problem that has emerged in e-commerce shopping is, customers, getting fake products in place of original products. 
                        This will decrease the sales and profit of the particular brand, including companies’ reputation. 
                        To remove or reduce the number of customers getting fake products in e-commerce shopping implemented using QR codes. 
                        Here Blockchain technology comes into the picture, where a QR code is generated using blockchain technology and attached to the product at the manufacturer’s side. 
                        Customers when they received the product can scan the QR code and check the authenticity of the product.
                        </P>
                        <P style="text-align: justify;">
                        we proposed a system using a web application. The web application is given to e-commerce companies as well as manufacturers, 
                        where sellers and e-commerce companies have a connection. This web application is added as functionality between e-commerce companies and the seller side. 
                        Where the product details are entered by the manufacturer using this application and will get a QR code once completed the transaction and the QR code is attached to the product Once the product or item is received by the end-user or customer, 
                        the QR code will be scanned by the end user and the end user will get to know whether the product is genuine or fake.
                        </P>

                        <P style="text-align: justify;">
                        There is no good solution before to differentiate fake products from original products. 
                        Blockchain technology can be helpful to tackle such problems. The project’s main goal is to help people to identify whether the product is an original product or a fake product.
                        We proposed a fake product detection system using blockchain technology for the detection of counterfeit products. The proposed system ensures the detection of fake products in day-to-day life. 
                        Block-Supply chain eliminates the need for a centralized authentication server utilized in most existing supply chains. Instead, it involves the nodes in the supply chain to do the authentication. 
                        Additionally, it can trace- and-track products without a centralized tracking server. Moreover, it detects the three counterfeiting attacks (modification, cloning, and tag reapplication) by involving the supply chain nodes transparently.
